# OsmJet
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) app for [Recon Jet](http://store.reconinstruments.com/Recon-Jet). I'm a big fan of Head-up Display technology. [Recon Jet](http://store.reconinstruments.com/Recon-Jet) is one of the products currently available. There are not many apps for it. I really missed [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) on it, so decided to build one.
